# Introduction

A collaborative project between CUSAT and Homomorphic Software Pvt Ltd with a grant from Ethereum foundation.

## Purpose of each module:

# metasave-fe
A client side for both user & hospital. 
User can view their fall details/close contacts/profile/hospital/devices.

# metasave-be
This handles all the functionalities like authentication/fall data/whatsapp messages to close contacts/user data/communicating with blockchain & IPFS/etc.

# metasave-contracts
This handles all the functionalities related to the smart contracts on the blockchain.

# Model
This contains the code for the YOLOv7-W6-Pose model, code for the Nano BLE Arduino script, and the python script to simulate a fall using the wearable device or the camera.

# Project Setup Guide

## Prerequisites

### For Both Windows and Linux

1. **Python**: 
   - Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Pip**: 
   - Pip should be installed with Python, but you can ensure it's up-to-date by running the following command:
     ```bash
     python -m ensurepip --upgrade
     ```

3. **CUDA (for GPU users)**:
   - If you have an Nvidia GPU and want to use CUDA, you need:
     - A CUDA-capable GPU
     - A supported version of Linux/Windows with a gcc compiler and toolchain
     - NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit: [CUDA Downloads](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
   - Check your GPU driver version with:
     ```bash
     nvidia-smi
     ```
   - Install or update your Nvidia drivers if necessary from: [Nvidia Drivers](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/).

  3. **NODE JS**:
    - Use Node v20.16.0 throughout the project
     ```bash
     nvm install 20.16.0
     nvm use 20.16.0
     node -v
     ```

### Install PyTorch

- **CPU Only**:
  ```bash
  conda install pytorch==2.3.1 torchvision==0.18.1 torchaudio==2.3.1 cpuonly -c pytorch
  ```
- **GPU and CPU (choose from either versions which are compatible with your current GPU model)**:
  
  **CUDA 11.8**  
  ```bash
  conda install pytorch==2.3.1 torchvision==0.18.1 torchaudio==2.3.1 pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
  ```
  **CUDA 12.1**  
  ```bash
  conda install pytorch==2.3.1 torchvision==0.18.1 torchaudio==2.3.1 pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
  ```

### Install External Libraries

- **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r packages/model/requirements.txt
    ```

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Setting Up Camera Device

- **Any USB port camera with a resolution of 1080*1920 or less should work. In the working directory, navigate to:**
    ```bash
    packages/model/camera.py
    ```

- **Ensure that the following line in the script is as is:**
   ```bash
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
    ```

0 is default for the system's native camera. You can set the value inside the VideoCapture function to other numbers, which represent additional peripherically connected cameras.

### Setting Up Wearable Device & Simulating a Fall

The camera.py script is capable of execution even if the wearable device isn't connected. But if you would like to set it up, follow this procedure:

- **Navigate to the ```packages/model/listenDevice.py``` script**
- **Change the ```SERIAL_PORT``` to the port your Arduino board is connected to**
- **Change the ```DEVICE_ADDRESS``` to the MAC address of your Arduino board**
- **Change the ```BAUD_RATE``` to the baud rate of your Arduino board**
- **Navigate to the ```packages/model/nano_ble_wired.ino``` script**
- **Upload the script to the Arduino board**
- **Change the directory back to the root of the project and run the following commands:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev-listen
    ```

That's it, you're all set to go

### Simulating a Fall with the camera

- **Navigate to the ```packages/model/camera.py``` script**
- **Change the ```SERIAL_PORT``` to the port your Arduino board is connected to**
- **Change the ```DEVICE_ADDRESS``` to the MAC address of your Arduino board**
- **Change the ```BAUD_RATE``` to the baud rate of your Arduino board**
- **Navigate to the ```packages/model/nano_ble_wired.ino``` script**
- **Upload the script to the Arduino board**
- **Change the directory back to the root of the project and run the following commands:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev-camera

    ```

### Simulating a Fall without a camera or wearable device

- **Change the directory back to the root of the project and run the following commands:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev-apitest
    ```

## Installation & Running the Project

This project uses a monorepo structure that includes both front-end and back-end components. To get started, run the following commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies for both front-end and back-end
npm install

# Run the front-end development server
npm run dev-fe

# Run the back-end development server
npm run dev-be
```
